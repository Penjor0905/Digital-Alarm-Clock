# Digital-Alarm-Clock
The design of a digital clock using Verilog HDL, focused on accurately displaying hours, minutes, and seconds. The clock is built with three main modules: a frequency division module that converts a 50 MHz input to a 1 Hz clock signal, a counting module to track time, and a decoding display module to format time for display. Simulated on an FPGA, the clockâ€™s functionality and accuracy are confirmed, showcasing Verilog HDL's efficiency and scalability in digital design, along with potential for adding features like alarms and alternate time formats.
