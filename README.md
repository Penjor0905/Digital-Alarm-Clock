The paper presents a digital clock design using Verilog HDL, with three main modules: frequency division (50 MHz to 1 Hz), time counting (hours, minutes, seconds), and decoding display. Simulated on an FPGA, it confirms accuracy and highlights Verilog HDLâ€™s efficiency, scalability, and potential for enhanced digital clock designs.
